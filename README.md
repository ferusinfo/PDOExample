# PDOExample
This repository contains simple project that uses `PDO` as a `mySQL` database connector.
Be aware, that it does not contain any client or serverside validations, but **it prevents SQL Injections**.

# Caution
This repository was created only for `university project`. Basically, code quality is `@#@!` here and looks like an oldfashion spagetti code. If you came here for good practices, I suggest you to correct my code and submit a pull request.

Code is a mix of Polish and English language, so watch your steps! :)
